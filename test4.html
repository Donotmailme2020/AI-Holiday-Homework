<h3>Cons</h3>
</font>

<font color="cyan" size="5" align="left">
<p align=left>1) High Costs of Creation
<br>Machines need repairing and maintenance which need plenty  of costs.


<br>2) Making Humans Lazy
<br>Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions which can cause a problem 
<br> to future generations.



<br>3) Unemployment
<br>As AI is replacing the majority of the repetitive tasks and other works with robots,human 
<br>interference is becoming less which will cause a major problem in the employment standards.



<br>4) Lacking Out of Box Thinking
<br>Machines can perform only those tasks which they are designed or programmed to do, anything out
<br> of that they tend to crash or give irrelevant outputs which could be a major backdrop.
