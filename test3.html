<br>Human-machine interactions refer to the contact between humans and machines to fulfil a specific task or 
<br>operation.In AI human-machine interactions done through the following domains:

<br>‣Data
<br>‣Computer Vision (CV)
<br>‣Natural Language Processing (NLP)
</p>

<br>It is a field of science that deals with how computers gain a high level of understanding from digital 
<br>images or videos. The computer vision includes the following methods to produce information:
<br>‣Acquiring Images
<br>‣Processing Images
<br>‣Analysing Images
<br>‣Understanding Images

<br>The programming languages work on their own principles, syntax, and keywords. The aim of NLP is developing 
<br> such systems that work on human natural language on oral as well-spoken language.
